## About
---
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Spotify songs from the Spotify Dataset API provided by kaggle. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in the file named `project.ipynb` under the root directory.

## Problem definition
---
Our project focuses on develping a model to predict the **popularity level** of any Spotify song in the Spotify dataset.

## Models Used
---
1. `DecisionTreeClassifier` model
2. `RandomForestClassifier` model

## What did we learn from this project
---
1. Handling raw datasets using resampling methods and `scikit-learn` package
2. `Graphviz` Usage
3. API Usage
4. `RandomForestClassifier` model
5. Calculate feature importance with a Random Forest based on feature permutation
6. Collaborating using GitHub
